##What is ICBM?

#### NOTE

**The current 1.7.10 versions are complete rewrites of ICBM, most things from 1.6.4 are not implemented yet. There are plans to implement missing content later, either in ICBM or in separate mods.**

ICBM is a Minecraft Mod that introduces intercontinental ballistic missiles to Minecraft.

##Who owns ICBM
Originally ICBM was owned mostly by Calclavia with the Sentry guns belonging to DarkGuardsman. After a few event and lack of progress ownership was shifted fully to DarkGuardsman. This was in exchange for majority ownership of Resonant Induction to Calclavia. 

That being said as far as DarkGuardsman is concerned the mod downloads are community property. At any time the mod is no longer supported or updated anyone is welcome to take over. Given that the new maintainer understands who owns the code at the end of the day.
